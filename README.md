2. You will be presented with various choices, each of which will lead down a separate path. Input the number corresponding with the path you wish to choose. (ex. Input 1 if you would like to choose the first path.)

3. If at any point you make a choice that causes you to lose, whether that be through combat or simply a bad choice, the game will say "Game over!" This means that you have to restart back from the beginning.

4. However, there are times where, instead of saying "Game over!" The game will say "Good Job." This also means that the game is over, but it means that you won. At this point you can choose to restart and choose a different path or choose to be done with the game.
